I am sick today. 
I woke up with a stuffy nose. 
I actually couldn't sleep in the first place 
because I felt sick the day before. 
I guess that's what they call as malaise. 
I have been staying up late until 3pm just to wait 
for parcels to get delivered. 
I also think that I have been lax in wearing my 
facial mask since I wanted to show off my glorious 
beard.
I've impulsively bought an office chair that was on
 sale. It was originally for eight thousand pesos and 
it was up for sale for around two thousand pesos.
That's including shipping.
I've been dreading getting sick since November. 
I hate the paper work associated with it especially
 when it's critical working days for Amazon.
I even mulled going there at 3 AM but that would
 mean me being selfish and getting other people sick.
Anyways, I decided not to go and take care of myself. 
I'm currently waiting for my porkchops and hotdogs
 to thaw. 
I'm going to make scrambled eggs also since I don't
 want to make the onions and garlic to go to waste.

I also decided to work on my projects.
Start the year right by starting the two days early,
I figured.
I have a new phone and I've been dreading putting up 
Git on it. 
Right now I'm on my Thinkpad x260 and started this 
thought repository. 
I figured that I can also flex my old git muscles by 
using git in a non-traditional way. 

Just my thoughts. No audience. Just me.

Got distracted. 
Instead of cooking I was just browsing Reddit.
So I installed the Reddit app. 
I have, however, retained the Redreader app since it 
doesn't autoplay videos and also has the chat 
function disabled. 

Anyways, I need to cook. Wish me luck.

I'm currently listenting to Procupine Tree. 
Thank you Spotify. 
I wouldn't have heard of this band without it.

Currently waiting for my brown rice to come through 
the microwave. 
3 minutes on high.
I wonder if the resistant starch would still take 
effect if I do that ...
Done a quick Google search and it seems that the 
scientific name for this is "starch retrogradation"
which increases resistant starch content. 
And it seems that reheating it lowered glycemic 
response compared with with freshly cooked rice. 

Whatever that means.

It's time to eat the frog. 

Going to conenct my Xiaomi Mi 13T to my Github 
repository.

I hope my old brain muscles are still up to it.

So I've successfully set up Git.

That wasn't so bad. 

Now let me check if it's best to clone or to push 
an existing repository from the command line
for 'thoughts' and 'code' repository.

So I'm no on my 13T. 

I've made some edits on the text to make it phone
friendly. 

I've used the "code clone" funcction for git.

The other method didn't work out for me.

Let me end this thought and try the add/commit/push
function.

See you on the other side.
