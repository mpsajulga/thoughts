2:30 AM

I am sick today. 
I woke up with a stuffy nose. 
I actually couldn't sleep in the first place because I felt sick the day before. 
I guess that's what they call as malaise. 
I have been staying up late until 3pm just to wait for parcels to get delivered. 
I also think that I have been lax in wearing my facial mask since I wanted to show off my glorious beard.
I've impulsively bought an office chair that was on sale. It was originally for eight thousand pesos and it was up for sale for around two thousand pesos.
That's including shipping.
I've been dreading getting sick since November. 
I hate the paper work associated with it especially when it's critical working days for Amazon.
I even mulled going there at 3 AM but that would mean me being selfish and getting other people sick.
Anyways, I decided not to go and take care of myself. 
I'm currently waiting for my porkchops and hotdogs to thaw. 
I'm going to make scrambled eggs also since I don't want to make the onions and garlic to go to waste.

I also decided to work on my projects. Start the year right by starting the two days early, I figured.
I have a new phone and I've been dreading putting up Git on it. 
Right now I'm on my Thinkpad x260 and started this thought repository. 
I figured that I can also flex my old git muscles by using git in a non-traditional way. 

Just my thoughts. No audience. Just me.

2:46 AM

Got distracted. 
Instead of cooking I was just browsing Reddit.
So I installed the Reddit app. 
I have, however, retained the Redreader app since it doesn't autoplay videos and also has the chat function disabled. 

Anyways, I need to cook. Wish me luck.
