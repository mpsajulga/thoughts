Woke up early but still sick. 
I looked up my paid sick leave and I still got 1 left.
Might as well take it than risk getting others sick.
I slept again as soon as I sent a SL ticket. 

When I went downstairs at 3 AM I found my brown rice
in a funky state. ADHD tax, again. 
I am now considering buying white rice at the break 
of dawn.

It's December 31 and I've got a holiday leave. 
The cerveza negra is cold. 
I'm going to make spaghetti later. 
Maybe the sardine variety or the pork. 
I'll leave that to my future self. 

Anyways, I need to break my fast. Ramen is in order.

Break
