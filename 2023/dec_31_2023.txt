Woke up early but still sick. 
I looked up my paid sick leave and I still got 1 left.
Might as well take it than risk getting others sick.
I slept again as soon as I sent a SL ticket. 

When I went downstairs at 3 AM I found my brown rice
in a funky state. ADHD tax, again. 
I am now considering buying white rice at the break 
of dawn.

It's December 31 and I've got a holiday leave. 
The cerveza negra is cold. 
I'm going to make spaghetti later. 
Maybe the sardine variety or the pork. 
I'll leave that to my future self. 

Anyways, I need to break my fast. Ramen is in order.

So I've figured out the reason why I've been having this 
bad pimple breakout on my forehead. Apparently it seems 
the culprit is Celetque. To be specific, it's the 
cleanser (with abrasive microplastics), toner, and moisturizer.
The pimple spot corrector is safe since I've been using that
for so long. 

So I've beend doing damage control with my skin. 
I bought the light blue Cetaphil which was my previous 
skin care product. Which reminds me. This problem started
when I bought the Cetaphil for oily skin. I had a pimple due
to that. So I switched to the Celeteque witout the 
microplastic which left my face clean and pimple free but 
a tad too dry. I then encountered a sale from Shopee for
Celeteque, DermaRepublic, The Ordinary  and that went downhill from there. 
And by that I meant I didn't let my skin adjust one by one.
I introduced all variables way too fast for me to know which
one is giving me this pimple break outs.

Anyways, I'm now using the Cetaphil light blue (not the blue, 
and apparently there's a differece) for cleanser. I don't know
yet if a serum acts as a moisturizer but now I'm using 
DermaRepubliq's serum as a moisturizer. I read somewhere it 
helps reduce inflammation. I guess my pimple breakouts could
be considered as inflammations since they were red and hot
to the touch. The last one on my list would then be to use 
celeteque's pimple corrector. 
Good thing about my skin is that I don't scar. Which is a good 
thing since I failed to mention that I usually remove pimple
cysts using a alcohol sanitize box cutter blades. Slit, push, 
pop, wipe, and sanitize. Let the the pimple clot. Blemish should
be gone in a week. 

Good thing I'm a guy. Nobody fucking cares what I do with my face.

It's morning now, I need to buy white rice for a change.

Did a quick inventory check. Found red tomatoes and quickly thought
I'd make ground pork tacos later. 
So when I went to the taboan, I found Ganador rice which was 
the most expensive and from what i remember also the best rice
I could buy within the locality. 
Also bough lemoncitos for the Philips water filter which was giving off
basic (literal) water. And I needed to spruce it up a bit. 
I also bough lettuce, onions, and garlic. There's already white
garlic within the refrigerator. 

Ooops. Got to go. Need to get my sunlight for the day.
