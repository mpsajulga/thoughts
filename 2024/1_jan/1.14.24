So it's been a week already? 

I think it's been a blur. 

Some thoughts about being on ATX:

I feel blunted. Not in a depressed way. More on situations
in which I know I could definitely handle it in a improvisional
way, I just go do it. Words flow fluidly and I am level headed.

With ATX. I am not. 

Also, I tried drinking alcohol while on ATX. God damn that 
car ride home was I the most cautious. Or atleast that's what
I felt. I have no recollection whatsover remembering how I 
got home. 

Yesterday, I was so groggy. I need to research the half-life
and effectivity of ATX since I also drank Ceterezine with my
lingering allergies. I tried to get up to work but my world
was spinning. 

Anyways. I just drank my ceterizine. I'll save my ATX before I 
go to work. I need to wake up at 7pm to catch the bus at 8pm. 
We've got a storm and I need to be able to adjust my schedule
to 8pm and do all my stuff within Amazon. Eat, CR, Study well
within 8:30pm-11pm.
