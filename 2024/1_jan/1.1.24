I decided to forgo going to SM Seaside nor to go to
the balcony of my cousin-in-law's to meet the new 
year. Not out of spite. Just a conscious decision
sit this one out. 

I remember years ago with my sister Kim. We thought
the fireworks was for Jan 1 in the evening. Not on
Dec 31 in the midnight. What a letdown that was but
also one of my best sleeps. 

I seem to have replicated that sleep. Not entirely.
I forgot I had the timer set at 11:30 pm. I quickly
smothered that and turned on the aircon and put in
my earplugs to drown out the noise.

I woke up again at around 3 am. 

I was a bit disappointed that I reactivated my social
media yesterday in the afternoon. Alcohol can really
fuck up my executive function. Atleast I stopped at
2 bottles. One was for a cerveza blanca. The other
for the cerveza negra. I really like the naming scheme
San Miguel Beer has opted for these two. I also think
I am going to stock on blanca since it has the same
flavor profile for Turning Wheel's Mountain Ale. 
I will forever be an alcoholic but I will have my 
say on what I drink from now on. Even if I will be
branded as a snob for it.

I digress. 

I started restrengthening my executive funnction.
As soon as I woke up, I did my back to basics skin
care routine along with my beard care routine. 
The overall beard situation still looks on point in
general. My moustache, however, needs a pomade or a 
wax. I already ordered online but I lament the selection
we have from our American counterparts. Filipinos 
generally do not sport moustaches. 

I digress.

After that, I took a shower and had a sudden urge
to change my laptop's SSD into Windows for a bit
so that I can finally finish re-flashing the rom on
my old phone for Seb to use.

Cannot do anything about it while still on the shower
so I made a mental note on it.

After doing so, I had to make my new year strong by
meditating. I chose Headspace's Prioritization pack.
It seemed appropriate. I read that ADHD is not about
Attention and Hyperactivity, per se. But a 
prioritization dysfunction. When everything is a 
priority, how can one balance one's life?

Anyways, after doing that I doomscrolled for a little
bit and took all the bad feelings from both social
media the same way I took on all bad feelings I had
after smoking my last cigarette when I was in college.
I stopped at the 50th stick, btw. I hate my hs/college
friend for introducing me to that vice. 

I digress. 

So I uninstalled both of them. I didn't want to make 
my inner child feel his toys were taken out again.
I still do recognize that it's a place where I can 
occasionally show off my amateur artistic tendencies.
And mental illnesses passed of as humor, of course.

Anyways I it's 06:32 am.

I need to eat and do sun salutations in a bit.

Break
