Done with the laundry. Now waiting for it to dry. 
It was a tricky one. There seems to be something
wrong with the washing machine. I need to check on it
tomorrow. 

I've tried AtomoX on the evening right after waking up.
The effect was, as the other reports say, made me 
very drowsy. I drank around three coffees: 1 before 
shift. Another at 'lunch'. And my last one at the last
break. I was still a bit drowsy. 

I'm going to try next time taking it at breakfast
next time.
