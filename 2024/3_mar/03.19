Long time no diary.
I am currently waiting for Intellicare to open.
For an errand to buy insurance for my parents,
on my sister's request.

While eating, I am eating breakfast. And now,
going to look at RHCSA certicates. I really
need to leverage my strengths now. I do have linux
knowledge and I do have a basics now on Git and
terminal knowledge. I think I may need to install 
Gentoo or Arch on my spare laptop just to learn
the intricacies of Linux more. I am now eyeing
linux administration. It looks like it's not 
saturated as other areas of IT/Tech.
