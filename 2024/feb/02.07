Got the second load of laundry running.
I need to get a haircut by 10 AM since Feb 11 
would be the Post Peak Party for Amazon. 
Also, I need to be sure my suit still works.
And I need to do a dry run with the elmer's glue
trick for my moustache. Should I buy the glue
stick? or the glue itself?
I need to research on that. 

BTW, I relapsed for a bit. I drank a san mig
light. Good thing it was just one bottle. 
I think I need to buy juice just in case I have
a need to drink a cold one.
