I forgot to take my ATX yesterday. 
I had 2 coffees to try and make up for it
But still I couldn't quite focus 
I was limping the entire night, 
so to speak.

Right now, I face my past self's
financial irresponsibility from the holidays.
I am now faced with withdrawing Lazada's 
25k fast cash just to pay off and 
stave for a couple of months my Shoppee
and Gcash loans and credits. 
A loan to bail out a loan. 
Trying to get myself out from quicksand
by shovelling and more quicksand underneath me
I need to get back on my feet and get atleast
one freelancing job on lined up 
as soon as possible. 

I hate unmedicated me. Even trying to sleep
is hard to do. There's a lot of friction
and it grates the inside of my brain.
