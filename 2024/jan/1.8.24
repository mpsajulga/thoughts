lunch break

Had 1/8th of Armodafinil since I need to adjust,
yet again, for night shift.

I still feel the Atomexetine's effects as soon as I
woke up. There was little to no friction to do my
nightly routine to get ready to work. I normally 
would dilly dally around my phone task paralyzed. 
Thinking if I should use the bus or to use the car
to work. I quickly decided to use the car. And I
usually kill the time after deciding the faster 
of the two option which makes me fashionably late. 
This time around, I was only 18 minutes late
because I had to go to the clinic to get a fit to 
work certificate. I actually ate and brushed my 
teeth. Usually, I don't if I wws time pressed. 

It's a bit too early to tell but I like how I am 
reacting well to this drug, atomexetine.

When I hit production, I wasn't my usual frenetic
self. I maybe still be readjusting though. 

I kinda miss my frenetic energy when I am at a loss
on how to help and what to say to a customer.
But I am also okay how it does not really affect me
that much anymore if I get "HMD Nos".

I am okay with baseline. But I also miss the highs.
Not so the lows.

I'll check if another shot of coffee can help me 
out on the high energy department. However, 
I do not want to borrow happiness.

I will meditate after the coffee and figure this out.
