Quick Update. 

Had atomexetine 25 mg as soon as I arrived and opened the packages
that were waiting for me while I was on vacation.
I initially thought it was expired upon seeing th April 2022.
I even got angry and hyperfocused for a bit to make a video
about it. When I finally was about to upload did I realize
that the date i was looking at was for the date of manufacture. 

That's a pretty scary mental headspace to be in. To be angry
without even knowing the full details. 

Not that I was that angry, I would've still drank the expired 
medicine, I just wanted to leave a 3 star review. 

Anyways. The reviews I read online mentioned that the drug
should take effect as much as 2 hours to a month of consistent use.
I think that I'm on the former. Memory was the most improved
on my end. 

Since I just got home, there were packages and baggages I need
to unpack. Being on Atom has made me prioritize food first. 
I cooked left over ground taco porn and rice. Unmedicated, 
I would've prioritized the computer chair since it's the most
dopamine available task at hand. 

Even as I write this at 1:13pm, I should be hyperfocused
on writing the nuances on the drug I am on right now. But as
of this moment, I would rather sleep.

Quick break.
