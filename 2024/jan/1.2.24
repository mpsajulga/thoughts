I'm at Malaybalay right now at the urging of my sister.
If I'm going to be sick I might as well be sick at home.

A lot of things happened yesterday. I finished installing
a new custom rom with my old phone. It's a funny named rom,
actually. Derpfest 13. And I was having second thoughts
in giving it to Seb since it's new, shiny, and chrome.
My dopamine levels are off the roof.

Well, it should've been but I quickly got off the dopamine
train. That's one project quickly done for 2024. I now have
three gifts ready to be gifted but I haven't really made
a vacation leave. I am, however, was sick. So I quickly
made the decision to go home.
