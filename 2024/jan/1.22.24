I am happy right now. I do not need to drink 
to borrow from tomorrow's happiness. 

It's Sinulog and the streets are packed,
lined up with party revelers or worshippers.
And I am not part of it. 
At the crack of dawn, I logged out of work.
Rode the bus, ate, worshipped the sun.
Then went to sleep to wake up at 6pm. 

I woke up and cleaned up a bit. 
My son is going to come in the next few days.
I do not need to be drunk to be happy. 
I only need to wait just a little bit.
