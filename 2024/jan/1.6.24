At the Macabalan Port right now. Just settled in 
from my bus trip.
I'm excited to tackle 2024 today. Energized and 
renewed my focus.
I'll have to do a tightrope balancing act on work, 
sleep, and taking care of myself. And depending 
on the effects of the ADHD meds I bought.

I want to become a writer. Certain events in my
life has made me a bit shaken but strangely calm. 
I know what to do. Maybe this was what anxiety 
is for. Constantly mulling over negative future 
events has made me ready for this. It's the same 
was I could say a witty remark. It's not that 
I'm witty, per se. I just had this conversation
already with on my head. 
Unless it's a non sequitur. 
That's definitely my ADHD.

Anyways. I've brought my Acer 1830T. 
The one I saved from the landfill. 
It's running Fedora Linux 39 (Workstation Edition). 
I wanted to distrohop to Voidi linux and even got
the iso ready for this one but I know it's a trap. 
Another ADHD project I would instantly lose interest
once I'm done with it. And good thing that the 
38 to 39 upgrade went well.
Because now it's still ready to work and type on. 
Incidentally, it has the cheap keyboard but I still 
get to type on it fast. This might have to do 
with it being a premium version of my old netbook 
crapbook I had during college. 

I just took a photo for my IG stories which made me 
realize that I am much more comfortable bringing 
out this old noisy laptop than my X260 might be an 
appeal my anxious side. I don't have to worry about 
it being stolen. 
That or I have such low self-esteem that I 
whole-heartedly seek out broken stuff because 
that's what I deserve. The dopamine rush I get from
fixing stuff is just the ADHD hyperfocus filling 
in that void. 

I've got some time to waste. I need to replace old 
bad habits such as social media to resurge during 
the holidays. I had to fill in the void somehow.
Next year, I need to be prepared and hopefully 
I have cemented good habits by that time. 

Break

I tried using VIM using this phone and keyboard. 
What a 10 minute nightmare that has been.
And I escaped it just in time. It's almost time to
board the ship. I'm going to ride the standard 
economy on Lite Shipping and it's going to be my
first time. I decided to go with my hiker look
even though I'm never been that guy. Just a mask
I tried on.
