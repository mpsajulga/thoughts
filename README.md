#thoughts

These are my thoughts. 

I've been mulling over a 
perfect place to place my thoughts. 
A shout in the void. 
A whish in the wind. 
Where only I could hear it.
Or maybe others could also if they are on the
right: 
Headspace
Downwind
Circumstance
Knowhow

Without ever secondguessing myself
if my thoughts are infecting affects
that are less inclined in my
Disposition?
Madness?
Headspace?

Anyways. I see a potential in this.

It's akin to
Threads
X/Twitter
Deviant Art Journals

But the only userbase is me.

And my thoughts.
